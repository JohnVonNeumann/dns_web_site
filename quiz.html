<!--
This page consists of a form where the user can enter:
    * their first name
    * their last name
    * student number
    * answers to at least 5 questions related to your topic

The questions should use 5 different input types:
    1. A text input question
    2. A multi choice question with one correct answer (radio button group)
    3. A multi choice question with multiple correct answers (check box group)
    4. A drop list with a single correct answer
    5. An input type of your choice other than the above
        eg: number, range, text area, image map, etc

Fieldsets and legends should be used appropriately to group inputs into questions

Labels and inputs should be linked with a for attribute

Before quiz answers are submitted HTML5 data validation should be used to check the following:
    * text and radio input questions must be answered
    * name and student id fields are not empty
    * the first and last name data should be checked to ensure it only consists of
        alpha chars, hyphens or spaces. A maximum of 25 characters.
    * the student number is either 7 or 10 digits

You must make a POST request to the provided server which will simply echo the
key value pairs back
